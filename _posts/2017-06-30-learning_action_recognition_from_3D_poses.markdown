Human action recognition is a classical problem in computer vision, with applications spanning human-computer interaction, video surveillance, and robotics. Skeleton based action recognition, also called 3D pose based action recognition, has recently attracted increasing attention due to 
both its succinct view-invariant representation. Following the success of deep learning methods in several computer vision tasks, recent work has focused on using deep recurrent neural networks to analyze skeleton sequences. 
In this work, after a thorough review of related topics, we examine concurrent deep learning methods. Our model based on recurrent neural networks achieves state-of-the-art performance on the largest dataset for skeleton based action recognition called NTU RGB+D. As a second contribution,  we design a dataset with YouTube videos recorded "in the wild" and extract skeleton sequences with a state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation method. Then, we use our model to predict an action label for each skeleton sequence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
 use skeleton-based action recognition on 3D pose extracted from real videos.
