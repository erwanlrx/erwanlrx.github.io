  <p> For an introduction to neural networks, I would advise to start with
  <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/"> Michael Nielsen free online book </a>.
  Then main recent results, such as LSTM or attention mechanisms, 
  are well illustrated in <a href="http://colah.github.io/"> Colah's blog </a> and  <a href="http://distill.pub/"> Distill </a> 
  To get thorough explanations, go for the 
  <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/"> Deep Learning book </a>  (2016) by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. </p>
  
  <p> More specialized blogs include:
 <a href="http://www.inference.vc/"> Inference blog </a> for a probabilistic view of recent deep learning papers
 or the recent  <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/"> Bair blog </a> dealing among other things with Reinforcement Learning.
 To keep track with AI related publications, you will find a lot of new articles 
  of varying quality on Arxiv. To keep pace with recent papers, you can use Karpathy's
   <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/"> Arxiv sanity </a>  tool.
   Also, <a href="https://jack-clark.net/import-ai/"> Jack Clark</a>  
  and <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml"> Denny Britz </a> 
  newletters make it possible to follow the increasing pace of AI. </p>
