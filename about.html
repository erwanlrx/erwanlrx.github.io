Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact the future world's shape. 
While studying AI, I realized how narrow was my current understanding of its potential applications. 
<b>Above all, I felt that, despite its hype and strength, 
most AI applications were completely disconnected from concrete world issues, and so was I.  
</b>
This awareness motivated the reconnaiction blog where posts are either in French or in English.  
As a young researcher, focused on climate extremes' evolution,  I still aim to reconnect AI/Statistics with life-saving problems. 
However, I do not believe that the change of paradigm, raised by climate change, can only be tackled scientifically. 
Thus, this blog contains both scientific popularization and poetic life-interrogations of varying quality 
mostly inspired by books I recently read.
