  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will impact the future world's shape. 
   While studying deep learning, I realized how narrow was my current understanding of its potential applications.
   Above all, I felt that, despite its hype and strength, most AI applications were completely disconnected from concrete world issues, and so was I. <br/> <br/>
   
   This paradox motivated the reconnaiction blog where posts are either in French or in English. <br/> <br/>
   
   Even if as a Phd student, strugling on climate extremes statistical modeling, I still aim to reconnect AI with life-saving problems.
   However, since its inception, this blog's focus has drifted away 
   and is now filled with crazy/bad poetic life-interrogations mostly inspired from books I recently read.
