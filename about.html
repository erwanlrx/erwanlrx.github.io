  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial. Its impact  (scientifically, socially, philosophically) is shaping the future world.
   While studying deep learning for computer vision, I realized how limited is my understanding of AI implications.
   This paradox motivated the reconnaiction blog. My initial modest project was to find some time to share quick summaries of AI advances.  </p>


  <p>My name is Erwan Le Roux. I am computer vision and machine learning researcher. 
  I started this blog at the end of my master thesis with Gregory Rogez and Cordelia Schmid in THOTH team at INRIA Grenoble. </p>

  <p> For an introduction to neural networks, I advise to start with
  <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/"> Michael Nielsen free online book </a>.
  Then main recent results, such as LSTM or attention mechanisms, 
  are well illustrated in <a href="http://colah.github.io/"> Colah's blog </a> and  <a href="http://distill.pub/"> Distill </a> 
  To get thorough explanations, go for the 
  <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/"> Deep Learning book </a>  (2016) by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. </p>

  To keep track with AI related publications, you will find a lot of new articles 
  of varying quality on Arxiv .  
	
	following Karpathy's <a href="https://jack-clark.net/import-ai/"> Arxiv sanity </a>  
   
   Also,   <a href="https://jack-clark.net/import-ai/"> Jack Clark</a>  
  and <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml"> Denny Britz </a> 
  newletters make it possible to follow the increasing pace of AI.
